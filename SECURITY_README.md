# Security Improvements for Kissan Agro Foods Website

This document provides instructions on how to fix the security issues that were encountered after implementing security improvements.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Internal Server Error (500)

If you encounter an Internal Server Error (500) after implementing the security improvements, it could be due to one of the following issues:

#### a. PHP Admin Value in .htaccess

The `php_admin_value` directive in the .htaccess file can only be set in the main server configuration file (httpd.conf) or in a VirtualHost container, not in .htaccess files.

**Solution:**
- Open the `.htaccess` file
- Comment out or remove the `php_admin_value` directive
- Restart the Apache server

#### b. Missing Database Tables

The security improvements require new database tables like `site_images` and `security_logs`.

**Solution:**
- Run the `fix_database.php` script to create the missing tables and insert default data
- Access the script at: `http://localhost/mill/fix_database.php`

#### c. PHP Version Compatibility

Some of the security functions may require a newer version of PHP.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using PHP 7.4 or higher
- If you're using an older version, update your PHP installation or modify the security functions to be compatible with your PHP version

### 2. Form Submission Issues

If you're having issues with form submissions, it could be due to the new form token validation.

**Solution:**
- Make sure all forms include the form token field: `<?php form_token_field('form_name'); ?>`
- Check that the form submission handler validates the form token
- If you need to temporarily disable form token validation, modify the `validate_form_token` function in `includes/form_security.php` to always return true

### 3. Database Connection Issues

If you're having issues with database connections, it could be due to the new database functions.

**Solution:**
- Make sure the database connection parameters in `config/database.php` are correct
- Check that the database user has the necessary permissions
- If you need to temporarily use the old database functions, modify the `db_query` function in `includes/db_functions.php` to use the old mysqli_query function
